# Haskell OpenGL projects
This repository contains my graphics programs I have made with Haskell.
I have switched from using Processing to Haskell to code my graphics programs.
You can find my Processing repo [here](https://github.com/MiksuLinuxGuy/processing-sketches).
I made the change because I got frustrated with the bugs that object oriented
programming allowed in my code.
Haskell restricts me from coding faulty code, which makes debugging super easy.

## Building the projects
The projects use `stack`. So you need to install it.
Build a project using `stack build` and run it using `stack run`.
